# Obsidian: A Second Brain?

Obsidian is sometimes called a second brain. This is because the structure of a vault, with notes connected by links, is the way a neural network is structured, with notes as nodes and links as edges. Such data structures are typically represented by [graphs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)>), and Obsidian has a built-in Graph View for this purpose.

In this video, I visually explore the concept of Obsidian as a second brain.
